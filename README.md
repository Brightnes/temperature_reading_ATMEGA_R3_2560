# temperature_reading_ATMEGA_R3_2560
Idea is making a simple circuit with an LED, a resistor and two push buttons in parallel, plus a temperature sensor to check for resistor temperature.

ATMEGA_R3_2560_temper_reading_1.JPG  is the starting setup circuitry. Next step is to add a temperature sensor.
